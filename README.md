### Game Concept:
- Tower-defense style game where attackers = cyber threats and defenders = cybersecurity measures.
- 3 stages (Intrusion, Persistence, Escalation) with 6 levels each.
- Example mapping:
  - Cleric = password management
  - Spy = exploiting web applications
  - Archer/Heavy Archer = basic & upgraded cyber defenses
  - Guild = multi-factor authentication
  - Messenger = phishing attacks


### Defenders vs ⚔ Attackers (Game → Real World)
- Spy → Web App Exploits
  - Example: Equifax breach (2017) via unpatched vulnerability.
  - Countermeasure: Vulnerability Scanning (Nets).
    
- Archer/Heavy Archer → Cyber Defenses
  - Represents layered security (firewalls, IDS, etc.).
  - Example: Target data breach (2013) exploited phishing entry point.

- Alchemist → Advanced Attacks (Proxy use, Escalation)
  - Countered by Privileged Account Management (Wizard Staff, Bell).
  - Example: Stuxnet worm exploited privilege escalation.

- Ninja → Brute Force Attacks
  - Real-world: login credential guessing.
  - Defense: Strong passwords, account lockouts.

- Clerk & Sign → Passwords + User Training
  - Example: Nvidia breach (2022) due to weak passwords.
  - Prevention: strong password policies, user awareness.

- Messenger → Phishing
  - Example: DoorDash breach (2022) via Twilio phishing.
  - Defense: user training + 2FA.

- Mirror Magi → Remote Access Exploits
  - Example: NetBus Trojan (1999) remote compromise case.
  - Defense: secure ports, DNS protection.

Cybersecurity Concepts Illustrated
- Vulnerability scanning (Active vs Passive Footprinting).
- Cyber defenses: Encryption, WAF, VPN, IDS, PAM.
- Password security & passphrases.
- User awareness training.
- Audit & privileged account management.
- Importance of layered defenses.

### Impact of Breaches (Case Studies)
- Equifax – 140M records stolen, stock dropped sharply.
- Target – 40M credit card details leaked.
- Nvidia – employee data exposed due to weak passwords.
- DoorDash – phishing attack leaked customer info.
- NetBus Trojan – reputational damage to a professor.


### Reflections & Group Dynamics
- Regular MS Teams meetings improved progress.
- Each member contributed attackers/defenders analysis.

- Lessons learned:
  - Data protection is critical.
  - Basic defenses (passwords, user training) are as important as advanced ones.
  - Cybersecurity is continuous—attackers always adapt.

### Key Takeaways
- Cybersecurity is like a strategy game: know your attackers, deploy the right defenses, patch vulnerabilities fast.
- Strong passwords, regular scanning, audits, and encryption are non-negotiable.
- Teamwork, vigilance, and adapting defenses are essential in real-world cybersecurity.
